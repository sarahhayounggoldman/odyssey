Title: Odyssey- A Comprehensive Platform for Sharing and Discovering Travel Experiences

Overview: 
  Odyssey is a social media website that’s like a combination of Google Reviews, Instagram, and a travel journal. Users can post reviews of different art museums, restaurants, architecture, and more, along with information about their travel budgets, how busy/“tourist-y” the place is, whether they traveled to the place alone/with friends/with family, and “life hacks”: a secret menu, a cheap motel nearby, etc. Users can also filter by country, budget, type of activity (culture, art/music, food, or other), and more! They can “follow” users with similar “traveler profiles” (age, travel interests, solo/group travelers) if they want travel inspiration, or they can follow users with different traveler profiles if they want to branch out. Odyssey allows for an entirely customizable experience: users can curate their feeds and find a community of travelers to connect with.

Status of project: 
This is the alpha version of the project. 
Currently, search, saved, followers, profile, edit, delete, like, post, and comment features have been implemented. 

Direction of use: 
To use Odyssey, users will first create a login or login to their existing account. Then, they can create a new post, explore other users'posts, search for posts based on country of interest, or interact with other users through commenting, liking, and following. Once they have created a post, users also have the option of editing and deleting their posts. In addition, users can also edit their profiles to include a bio.
