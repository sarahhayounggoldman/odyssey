Overview: 
Odyssey is a social media website that’s like a combination of Google Reviews, Instagram, and a travel journal. Users can post reviews of different art museums, restaurants, architecture, and more, along with information about their travel budgets, how busy/“tourist-y” the place is, whether they traveled to the place alone/with friends/with family, and “life hacks”: a secret menu, a cheap motel nearby, etc. Users can also filter by country, budget, type of activity (culture, art/music, food, or other), and more! They can “follow” users with similar “traveler profiles” (age, travel interests, solo/group travelers) if they want travel inspiration, or they can follow users with different traveler profiles if they want to branch out. Odyssey allows for an entirely customizable experience: users can curate their feeds and find a community of travelers to connect with.

Status of project: 
This is the beta version of the project. 
Previously, search, saved, followers, profile, edit, delete, like, post, and comment features have been implemented. 
In the new beta version, we added edit bio, add/edit profile picture, and unlike featues. In addition, we also debugged sort by budget. 

Direction of use: 
To use Odyssey, users will first create a login or login to their existing account. Then, they can create a new post, explore other users'posts, search for posts based on country of interest, or interact with other users through saving posts, commenting, liking/unliking, and following. They can also filter posts based on their interest to better help them explore different posts. Once they have created a post, users also have the option of editing and deleting their posts. In addition, users can also edit their profiles to include a bio and profile picture.
